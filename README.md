# AR-Application
This is an AR app that I created and this contains two different features.
One that takes you to a scene where you can select from dfferent characters that you can choose from and
than each of these characters will be consisting of their own animations which can be performed by them 
at the user's will.
The other takes you a video Player scene where you can Play, Pause and Stop the video.

 The Animations and Characters that are used here are from "Mixamo.com" and the icons used to represent
the different actions in the App are from "Icons8.com".
 
 The video that will be played in the Video Player is Teaser of the "The Elder Scrolls 6" owned by Bethesda Game Studios.
 
 The "Mars Cards 3" consist the image on which you can view the AR Project.
